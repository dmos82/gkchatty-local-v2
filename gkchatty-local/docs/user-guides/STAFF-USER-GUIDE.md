## Tips & Best Practices

### Asking Better Questions

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Tell me about policies" | "What is the remote work policy for full-time employees?" |
| "Sales stuff" | "What were our top-selling products in Q3 2024?" |
| "Help with expenses" | "What is the process for submitting travel expense reimbursements?" |

### General Tips

1. **Be specific**: Include dates, names, or specific topics
2. **Use natural language**: Write questions as you would ask a colleague
3. **Check search mode**: Ensure you're searching the right document collection
4. **Review sources**: Always verify important information against source documents
5. **Upload relevant docs**: Add documents you frequently reference to your personal library

### Privacy Considerations

- Your personal documents are only visible to you
- Chat history is saved to your account
- Administrators can view system usage statistics (not your specific chats)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"

- Try rephrasing your question
- Check if you're searching the correct collection (System KB vs User Docs)
- Ensure relevant documents have been uploaded
- Use different keywords

### Upload fails

- Check file size limits
- Ensure the file type is supported (PDF, TXT, MD)
- Try a different browser
- Contact your administrator if issues persist

### Slow responses

- Complex questions take longer to process
- Large document collections may increase search time
- Check your internet connection
- Wait for the progress indicator to complete

### Can't log in

- Verify your username/email is correct
- Check that CAPS LOCK is off
- Try resetting your password
- Contact your administrator for assistance
