# Notes
notes: |
  This is a Builder Pro + PixelLab MCP integration stress test:
  - Complete BMAD-Pro-Build workflow (6 phases)
  - AI-generated sprites via PixelLab MCP (validated working)
  - Phaser 3 game engine embedded in Next.js
  - 92% token-efficient RAG pattern

  Phase Status:
  ✅ Phase 0: Requirements Complete (10 user stories)
  ✅ Phase 1: Architecture Complete (15,000 lines)
  ✅ Phase 2: Discovery Complete (Phaser patterns identified)
  ✅ Phase 3: Planning Complete (18 tasks, 24 hours)
  ⏳ Phase 4: Implementation (Next - generate sprites → build game)
  ⏳ Phase 5: QA Review (7-phase validation with Playwright)
